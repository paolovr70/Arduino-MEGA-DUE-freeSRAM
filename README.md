# Arduino MEGA2560/DUE freeSRAM
This repository contains an ARDUINO sketch usefull for CALCULATING FREE SRAM both for ARDUINO MEGA2560 and ARDUINO DUE. It has been relised collecting more codes searched in ARDUINO FORUMS and other repositories.
In a first step the sketch determines wich board is used (because AVR and ARM requires dirretents routines). Then in a second step it calculater the FREE SRAM. The MEGA2560 sub-code has been tested and compared to arduino library "freememory.h".
