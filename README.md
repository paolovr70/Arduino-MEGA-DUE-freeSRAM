# Arduino-MEGA-DUE-freeSRAM
This repository contains ARDUINO code usefull for CALCULATING FREE SRAM both for ARDUINO MEGA2560 and ARDUINO DUE.
In a first step it determines wich board is used (because AVR and ARM requires dirretents routines). Then in a second step it calculater the FREE SRAM. The MEGA2560 sub-code has been tested and compared to arduino library "freememory.h".
